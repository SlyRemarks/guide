# Creating Daily Averages

This guide details how to generate interval based averages i.e hourly, or timezone correct: daily, weekly and monthly averages from emoncms feeds. Designed for determining power, temperature and humidity averages.

To generate average data first click on the eye icon for the feed you wish to use from the emoncms feed list to bring up the feed in the default data viewer called graph.



Note: At present this feature can provide averages over the entire feed length on emoncms.org but is limited to the last 7 days on emonpi or self-hosted emoncms installs. This is due only to a need to implement the background processes required on emonpi/local installs which has not been completed yet.
