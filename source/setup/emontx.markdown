## Additional energy monitoring nodes

Additional energy monitoring nodes can be added if more AC circuits require monitoring or the monitoring location of the circuits is inconvenient to access power outlet and network connectivity.

- Energy monitoring add-on node
- Optional add-on if more then two circuits need to be monitored or if WiFi / Ethernet connectivity is not available at utility meter
- RF Range is approximately similar to home WiFi and can be affected by obstacles e.g. thick stone walls
- Up to 4 x emonTx can be connected to a single emonPi

<p class='note'>
An emonTx can be powered by 3 x AA batteries; however, if possible, it is recommended to power the unit with an AC-AC adapter to provide an AC voltage reference for more accurate Real Power and VRMS calculations.
